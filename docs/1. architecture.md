# This are the rules the AI must follow to generate custom applications:

## Language
Golang

## Reference
Base off of /Users/pvillalobos/Documents/poc/local to follow the structure

Below you can see a structure chart of how local works, we need to follow the same patterns.

## Layouts
The application must have the following layers:
- DB (postgres)
- Server (http)
- Client (html)

## Server Structure
The server layout must follow the bellow structure:

REST
    REST will be the workspace where all services will be stored within. Each service will be created here as a standalone service. i.e: inventory_service, payment_service, etc.
    
    - storage: The first service to be created is storage_service which will handle all db-related connections. All the services must be connected and pinging storage_service to function.

    - internals: ** TBD: Need to plan all the services that will be created here.

    - gateway: This will be the point of comunication between the ui and the internal services. Gateway will be in charge of user authentication and authorization using jwt token. Besides injecting metadata avoind direct connection to internal services.

    - ui: this service will handle all the pages and user interface content, using html and bootstrap.

    ### Structure
    ui -> gateway -> internal services -> storage

## Environment setup.
Base on the local project, we need to use docker, docker-compose and kubernetes setup. We have colima installed so we can set it up and work it locally with that.

## Makefile Standards

**Each service's Makefile must contain Docker-related commands and test commands only.**

Do NOT include:
- `build` (Go build commands)
- `run` (direct Go run)
- `deps` (Go mod commands)

DO include:
- `start` - Start Docker containers
- `stop` - Stop Docker containers
- `restart` - Restart containers
- `logs` - View container logs
- `status` - Show container status
- `clean` - Remove containers/volumes
- `test` - Run tests
- `help` - Show available commands

Example Makefile structure:
```makefile
.PHONY: start stop restart logs status clean test help
.DEFAULT_GOAL := help

start: _network
	@cd docker && docker-compose up -d

stop:
	@cd docker && docker-compose down

restart: stop start

logs:
	@cd docker && docker-compose logs -f

status:
	@cd docker && docker-compose ps

clean:
	@cd docker && docker-compose down -v

test:
	@go test -v ./...

help:
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST)

_network:
	@docker network create docker_barrest_network 2>/dev/null || true
```

This ensures consistent Docker-based development across all services.
